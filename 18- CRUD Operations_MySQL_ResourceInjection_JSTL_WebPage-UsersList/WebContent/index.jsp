		<h3> My name is Filipe Ribeiro </h3>
		<p>I am graduated in European Computer Science, where the first two
			years were in Coimbra Institute of Engineering (ISEC), and the third
			year in a international university where I end up going to Timisoara,
			Romania, specifically in University of West Timisoara (UVT). Through
			this last year I gained the taste of living in an international city.
			I want Netherlands to be my next step, because truth said this
			country is very developed in several departments but specially in
			Software Development, and frankly I want to be a part of it because I
			want to be near the best in order to improve better and faster.
				Though I dont have professional experience, I really love coding so
			I inscribe myself in courses of Udemy to keep on touch with code and
			to learn more. 
			Since in this field many technologies tend to
			deprecated, and replaced by new ways of doing it, this part of me
			where I tend to learn on me and search by me, will be a must for me
			and I will use it as warranty of my commitment to the company. Even
			if in my CV I dont have a certain requirement Ill search for it on
			my own to be ready for the new challenges incoming.
